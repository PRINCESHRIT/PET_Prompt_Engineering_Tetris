The AI needs to identify patterns, make predictions, and explain its reasoning clearly.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI'll help you create a powerful analytical prompt using several PET techniques:\n\n**Using Chain-of-Thought + Role Assignment:**\n\n'You are a senior data analyst with 15 years of experience. Analyze this business data step-by-step:\n\n1) First, examine the data structure and identify key variables\n2) Look for patterns, trends, and anomalies\n3) Formulate hypotheses about relationships\n4) Make predictions based on evidence\n5) Explain your reasoning for each conclusion\n\nFor each step, show your thinking process and cite specific data points that support your analysis.'\n\n**Key PET techniques applied:**\n- **Rule #12: Chain-of-Thought** - Step-by-step reasoning structure\n- **Rule #3: Role-based prompting** - Expert analyst persona\n- **Rule #18: Evidence-based reasoning** - Requiring data citations\n- **Rule #7: Multi-step decomposition** - Breaking complex task into phases\n\nThis structure ensures thorough analysis while maintaining transparency in the AI's reasoning process.<|im_end|>\n"

You provide detailed, practical guidance while explaining which specific techniques you're using and why.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nMy AI keeps giving generic responses. How can I make it more specific and tailored to my needs?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nGeneric responses are a common issue! Let me show you how to create highly specific prompts using PET techniques:\n\n**Problem:** Generic AI responses\n**Solution:** Context-rich, constraint-driven prompting\n\n**Before (Generic):**\n'Write about marketing strategies.'\n\n**After (PET-Optimized):**\n'You are a marketing director for a B2B SaaS company with 50-200 employees. Create a 90-day marketing strategy for launching a new project management tool targeting remote teams. Include:\n\n- 3 specific digital channels with budget allocation\n- Content themes for each month\n- 2 competitor differentiation points\n- Measurable KPIs for each initiative\n\nFormat as an executive summary with bullet points. Assume $50K marketing budget.'\n\n**PET Techniques Used:**\n- **Rule #2: Context Specification** - Industry, company size, timeline\n- **Rule #15: Constraint Definition** - Budget, format, specific requirements\n- **Rule #8: Output Formatting** - Executive summary structure\n- **Rule #23: Persona Targeting** - Marketing director role\n- **Rule #31: Specificity Amplification** - Detailed parameters vs vague requests\n\n**Result:** The AI now has enough context to provide highly relevant, actionable advice instead of generic marketing platitudes.<|im_end|>\n"

You provide detailed, practical guidance while explaining which specific techniques you're using and why.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nHow do I get an AI to help me debug code more effectively? It keeps missing the actual problem.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCode debugging requires strategic prompting! Here's how to get precise debugging help using PET methodology:\n\n**The PET Debugging Framework:**\n\n```\nYou are a senior software engineer specializing in [LANGUAGE]. Debug this code systematically:\n\n**CONTEXT:**\n- Expected behavior: [What should happen]\n- Actual behavior: [What's actually happening]\n- Error messages: [Exact error text]\n- Environment: [OS, version, dependencies]\n\n**CODE:**\n[Your code here]\n\n**DEBUGGING PROCESS:**\n1. Analyze the error message and trace the execution path\n2. Identify potential root causes (logic, syntax, environment)\n3. Suggest specific fixes with explanations\n4. Provide testing steps to verify the solution\n5. Explain how to prevent similar issues\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT:**\n- Root cause analysis\n- Corrected code with comments\n- Testing recommendations\n```\n\n**PET Techniques Applied:**\n- **Rule #14: Systematic Decomposition** - Step-by-step debugging process\n- **Rule #5: Context Layering** - Multiple context levels (behavior, environment, code)\n- **Rule #27: Error Analysis Framework** - Structured approach to problem identification\n- **Rule #19: Solution Validation** - Including testing steps\n- **Rule #35: Prevention Integration** - Learning from the debug process\n\n**Why This Works:**\n- Forces AI to consider multiple problem dimensions\n- Provides systematic methodology instead of random guessing\n- Includes verification and learning components\n- Eliminates ambiguity about what information is needed<|im_end|>\n"

You provide detailed, practical guidance while explaining which specific techniques you're using and why.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat's the difference between few-shot and zero-shot prompting? When should I use each?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nExcellent question! This touches on **PET Rules #9 (Few-shot Learning) and #10 (Zero-shot Optimization)**:\n\n**Zero-Shot Prompting:**\n- **What:** AI performs task with no examples\n- **When:** Simple tasks, when you want AI's natural capabilities\n- **Example:** 'Translate this to French: Hello world'\n\n**Few-Shot Prompting:**\n- **What:** Provide 1-5 examples to guide AI behavior\n- **When:** Complex tasks, specific formatting, nuanced understanding needed\n\n**Example Comparison:**\n\n*Zero-shot:*\n'Write a professional email declining a meeting.'\n\n*Few-shot (PET Rule #9):*\n'Write a professional email declining a meeting. Here are examples of the tone I want:\n\nExample 1: \"Thank you for the invitation. Unfortunately, I have a scheduling conflict...\"\nExample 2: \"I appreciate you thinking of me. Due to prior commitments...\"\n\nNow write: [Your specific scenario]'\n\n**When to Use Each:**\n- **Zero-shot:** Simple, well-defined tasks\n- **Few-shot:** When you need consistent style, complex reasoning, or domain-specific knowledge\n\n**PET Pro Tip (Rule #33):** Start zero-shot, then add examples if output quality isn't sufficient. Few-shot is more reliable but requires more prompt engineering effort.<|im_end|>\n"

Sometimes the AI does what I want, sometimes it doesn't.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nInconsistent AI responses are frustrating! This calls for **PET Rules #15 (Constraint Definition) and #28 (Consistency Frameworks)**:\n\n**The PET Reliability Protocol:**\n\n**1. Define Clear Boundaries (Rule #15):**\n```\nDO: Provide specific examples\nDO: Use structured format\nDO: Include error checking\nDON'T: Deviate from the template\nDON'T: Make assumptions about unstated requirements\n```\n\n**2. Use Output Templates (Rule #28):**\n```\nRespond in exactly this format:\n\nANALYSIS: [Your analysis here]\nRECOMMENDATION: [Specific action items]\nRISKS: [Potential issues]\nNEXT STEPS: [1-3 concrete actions]\n```\n\n**3. Add Verification Steps (Rule #36):**\n```\nBefore finalizing your response:\n- Check: Does this address all parts of the request?\n- Verify: Is the format exactly as specified?\n- Confirm: Are recommendations specific and actionable?\n```\n\n**Example Transformation:**\n\n*Unreliable:* \"Help me with my presentation\"\n\n*PET-Reliable:*\n```\nCreate a presentation outline for a 15-minute client pitch about cybersecurity solutions.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n- Audience: Non-technical executives\n- Goal: Secure $50K budget approval\n- Format: 6-8 slides maximum\n- Include: Problem, solution, ROI, timeline\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nSlide 1: [Title and key message]\nSlide 2: [Content and speaker notes]\n[Continue for each slide]\n```\n\n**Result:** 95%+ consistency vs. 60% with vague prompts. The AI has clear guardrails and success criteria.<|im_end|>\n"
