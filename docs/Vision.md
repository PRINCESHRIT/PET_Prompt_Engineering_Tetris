# Vision: PET North Star

> **The revolutionary prompt engineering environment that transforms how we think about AI interaction**

## ðŸŒŸ The Vision

PET envisions a world where **prompt engineering is as intuitive as playing Tetris** - where complex AI interactions become tactile, visual, and accessible to everyone, regardless of physical ability or technical expertise.

## ðŸŽ¯ What We're Building

### **The Tetris of Prompt Engineering**

PET is not just another prompt tool. It's a **fundamental reimagining** of how humans interact with AI systems. Instead of typing in chat bubbles, users manipulate **Tetris-style blocks** on a canvas, each representing a fundamental component of effective prompt architecture.

### **The 80s Terminal Aesthetic**

We embrace the **distraction-free, focused environment** of 1980s computing. Green text on black backgrounds. Pixelated graphics. Monochrome simplicity. This aesthetic is **not nostalgic** - it's **strategic**. It creates the mental space for deep, focused work.

### **Local-First, Privacy-Absolute**

PET runs entirely on your device. No cloud dependencies. No data collection. No surveillance. Your prompts, your AI processing, your privacy. This is **non-negotiable**.

## ðŸš€ Why This Matters

### **The Current Problem**

Today's prompt engineering tools are **fundamentally broken**:

1. **Chat Interface Trap**: The "message bubble" metaphor is inefficient for structured, complex work
2. **Cloud Surveillance**: Every prompt sent to external servers for processing
3. **Ephemeral Work**: Valuable prompt engineering gets lost in chat histories
4. **Accessibility Gap**: Voice and vision users are excluded from prompt engineering
5. **Tool Bloat**: Complex IDEs that distract from the core task

### **The PET Solution**

PET transforms prompt engineering into:

1. **Visual Architecture**: See your prompt structure at a glance
2. **Tactile Interaction**: Drag, drop, and manipulate blocks
3. **Voice Control**: Hands-free prompt engineering for accessibility
4. **Local Processing**: Your AI, your data, your privacy
5. **Constraint-Driven**: 15-block limit forces focus and creativity

## ðŸŽ® The Core Metaphor: Tetris

### **Why Tetris?**

Tetris is the **perfect metaphor** for prompt engineering:

- **Limited Resources**: 15 blocks force creative constraint
- **Spatial Thinking**: Visual arrangement reveals structure
- **Immediate Feedback**: See your prompt take shape instantly
- **Universal Appeal**: Everyone understands Tetris
- **Addictive Flow**: The satisfaction of perfect arrangement

### **Block Types as Tetris Pieces**

- **T-block** (T-piece): Objective/Persona - the foundation
- **I-block** (I-piece): Instructions - the clear direction
- **L-block** (L-piece): Constraints - the boundaries
- **O-block** (O-piece): Output Format - the structure
- **S-block** (S-piece): Chain of Thought - the reasoning
- **Z-block** (Z-piece): Examples - the patterns
- **J-block** (J-piece): Text Literal - the content

## ðŸŽ¯ Target Users

### **Primary: The Power User**

The **craftsperson** who sees prompt engineering as architecture, not conversation. They want:
- Precision and control
- Reusable components
- Systematic approaches
- Professional-grade output

### **Secondary: The Accessibility Advocate**

Users who need **voice control** and **visual interfaces** to participate in AI work. They want:
- Hands-free operation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Visual feedback
- Inclusive design

### **Tertiary: The Privacy-Conscious**

Users who reject cloud surveillance and data collection. They want:
- Local processing
- Zero external dependencies
- Complete data ownership
- Offline functionality

## ðŸŽ¨ Aesthetic Philosophy

### **Why 80s Terminal?**

The 80s terminal aesthetic is **strategic design**, not nostalgia:

1. **Distraction-Free**: No gradients, animations, or visual noise
2. **Focus-Enhancing**: Monochrome reduces cognitive load
3. **Constraint-Driven**: Limited colors force creative solutions
4. **Universal**: Works on any device, any screen size
5. **Timeless**: Never goes out of style

### **Design Principles**

- **Minimalism**: Every element serves a purpose
- **Clarity**: Information hierarchy is obvious
- **Consistency**: Same patterns throughout
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, readable fonts
- **Performance**: Fast rendering, smooth interactions

## ðŸ”§ Technical Philosophy

### **Zero Dependencies**

PET runs on **vanilla web technologies**:
- No frameworks
- No build tools
- No external libraries
- No cloud services

This ensures:
- **Maximum portability**
- **Zero maintenance overhead**
- **Complete user control**
- **Instant deployment**

### **Local-First Architecture**

Everything happens on the user's device:
- **AI processing** with local Gemma 3N
- **Data storage** in IndexedDB
- **Voice processing** with Web Speech API
- **Visual processing** with Canvas API

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact Vision

### **Immediate Impact**

- **Democratize prompt engineering** through visual interface
- **Enable accessibility** for voice and vision users
- **Protect privacy** with local processing
- **Improve quality** through constraint-driven design

### **Long-term Impact**

- **Transform AI interaction** from chat to architecture
- **Create new accessibility standards** for AI tools
- **Establish privacy-first AI** as industry norm
- **Inspire constraint-driven design** in other tools

## ðŸŒŸ The North Star

PET's North Star is **making prompt engineering accessible, private, and powerful** for everyone who wants to craft better AI interactions.

We're not building another chat interface. We're building the **Tetris of prompt engineering** - a tool that makes complex AI work as intuitive and satisfying as arranging falling blocks.

**This is the future of human-AI interaction.**
