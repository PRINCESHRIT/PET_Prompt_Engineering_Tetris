# PET (Prompt Engineering Tetris)

> **Revolutionary offline-first prompt engineering meets Tetris from the 1980s**

## 🎯 Mission

PET is a radically minimalist, privacy-respecting prompt engineering environment that transforms complex prompt creation into an intuitive, tactile experience. Built for power users who see prompt engineering as architecture, not conversation.

## 🚀 What is PET?

PET is a **featherweight power tool** that combines:

- **Tetris-style visual interface** with 15-block constraint system
- **Local Gemma 3N AI** for intelligent block suggestions and validation
- **Voice control** for hands-free prompt engineering
- **Offline-first architecture** with zero cloud dependencies
- **80s terminal aesthetic** for distraction-free focus
- **Research-based validation** scoring (0-100) with improvement suggestions

## 🎮 Core Concept

Instead of typing prompts in a chat interface, users manipulate **Tetris-style blocks** on a canvas:

- **T-block** = Objective/Persona definition
- **I-block** = Instructions with clear verbs  
- **L-block** = Constraints and limitations
- **O-block** = Output format specification
- **S-block** = Chain-of-thought reasoning
- **Z-block** = Examples and use cases
- **J-block** = Raw text content

## 🎯 For Whom is PET Built?

PET is built for:
- **Power users** who craft prompts as architecture
- **Systems thinkers** who see patterns and structure
- **Craftspeople** who value precision and control
- **Privacy-conscious users** who reject cloud surveillance
- **Accessibility advocates** who need voice/vision control
- **The child in you** who loves Tetris and creative constraint

## 🛡️ Core Principles

### **Privacy Absolute**
- Zero cloud dependencies
- All AI processing local with Gemma 3N
- No telemetry or data collection
- User owns their work completely

### **Constraint-Driven Design**
- 15-block maximum enforces focus
- Tetris aesthetic promotes creative constraint
- Offline-first ensures reliability
- Vanilla JS ensures portability

### **Accessibility First**
- Voice control for hands-free operation
- Visual block interface for spatial thinking
- Screen reader compatibility
- Mobile-first responsive design

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Modern browser with Web Speech API support
- 2GB+ RAM for local AI processing
- No internet required after initial setup

### Installation
```bash
# Clone PET repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/pet-prompt-engineering-tetris.git
cd pet-prompt-engineering-tetris

# Open in browser (no build step required)
open index.html
```

### First Steps
1. **Load PET** - Single HTML file opens instantly
2. **Add blocks** - Drag Tetris pieces or use voice commands
3. **Fill content** - Click blocks to edit or dictate content
4. **Validate** - Get research-based scoring and suggestions
5. **Compile** - Generate final prompt from active blocks
6. **Save** - Store prompts locally for reuse

## 🎮 Voice Commands

- **"T-block"** - Add objective/persona block
- **"I-block"** - Add instructions block
- **"L-block"** - Add constraints block
- **"Validate prompt"** - Score current prompt
- **"Compile blocks"** - Generate final prompt
- **"Clear workspace"** - Reset canvas

## 📊 Validation Scoring

PET uses research-based validation (0-100 scale):

- **90-100**: Exceptional - Publication-worthy
- **80-89**: Excellent - Professional-grade
- **70-79**: Good - Solid with minor improvements
- **60-69**: Fair - Functional but needs refinement
- **50-59**: Poor - Significant issues present
- **0-49**: Unusable - Fundamental problems

## 🎨 Aesthetic Philosophy

PET embraces the **80s terminal aesthetic**:
- Monochrome green text on black background
- Pixelated fonts and block graphics
- Minimalist interface design
- Distraction-free focus environment
- Retro gaming nostalgia

## 🔧 Development

### Tech Stack

- **AI**: Local Gemma 3N via WebAssembly/ONNX.js
- **Voice**: Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition + SpeechSynthesis)
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for conversation versioning
- **Zero Dependencies**: No external libraries or frameworks

### Development Setup
```bash
# No build tools required
# Edit files directly and refresh browser
# PET runs entirely in the browser
```
