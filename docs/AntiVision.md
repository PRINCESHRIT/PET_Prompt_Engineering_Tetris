# AntiVision: What PET is NOT

> **Explicit boundaries to prevent scope creep and maintain focus**

This document defines what PET is **not**. Its purpose is to set clear boundaries and ensure the project remains true to its core vision of being a simple, lightweight, and private power tool. By explicitly stating what we will avoid, we protect the project from bloat and distraction.

## 🚫 PET is NOT:

### **A Cloud-Based Collaboration Platform**

PET is **not** a real-time, multi-user tool like Google Docs or Figma. There will be:
- ❌ No shared workspaces
- ❌ No live cursors
- ❌ No comment threads
- ❌ No user accounts
- ❌ No cloud synchronization

**Why**: Our core principle is offline-first and radical privacy. PET is a power tool for individual craftsmanship, not team collaboration.

### **A "Kitchen Sink" IDE**

PET will **not** become a replacement for VS Code. We will not add:
- ❌ General-purpose coding features
- ❌ Debuggers or integrated terminals
- ❌ Extensive plugin support
- ❌ File management systems
- ❌ Version control integration

**Why**: The focus is exclusively on the art and architecture of prompt engineering. Adding unrelated features would violate the "featherweight" principle and distract from the core mission.

### **Another Chatbot Interface**

PET is **not** a conversational AI chat app. We will never adopt:
- ❌ The "message bubble" UI that we are actively working to replace
- ❌ Chat history timelines
- ❌ Conversation threading
- ❌ Multi-turn dialogue management

**Why**: PET is the tool used to **build the logic for** chatbots. The interface is a workspace for construction, not a timeline for conversation.

### **A SaaS Product Requiring User Accounts**

PET will **not** require users to:
- ❌ Sign up or log in
- ❌ Have profiles or accounts
- ❌ Pay subscription fees
- ❌ Connect to external services

**Why**: The tool is local-first. We will not build authentication systems or cloud profiles that compromise simplicity and privacy.

### **A Tool with a "Modern & Friendly" UI**

We will **not** add:
- ❌ Smooth animations and transitions
- ❌ Gradients and shadows
- ❌ Complex graphical elements
- ❌ Bubbly onboarding flows
- ❌ Generic, modern design trends

**Why**: The retro, 80s-terminal aesthetic is a deliberate and non-negotiable feature. It promotes focus, embraces constraint, and is fundamental to the tool's identity.

### **A Data Collection Engine**

PET will **never** include:
- ❌ Telemetry or analytics
- ❌ User tracking or behavior monitoring
- ❌ Data collection for "improvement"
- ❌ External reporting or metrics

**Why**: This is a zero-compromise principle. The user's work and data are their own. Period.

### **A Mobile App**

PET is **not** a native mobile application. We will not:
- ❌ Build iOS or Android apps
- ❌ Use React Native or Flutter
- ❌ Create app store listings
- ❌ Implement mobile-specific features

**Why**: PET is a web application that works on any device with a browser. This ensures maximum accessibility and portability.

### **A Machine Learning Platform**

PET is **not** a general-purpose ML tool. We will not add:
- ❌ Model training interfaces
- ❌ Data preprocessing tools
- ❌ Feature engineering capabilities
- ❌ Model deployment features

**Why**: PET is focused on prompt engineering, not machine learning infrastructure. The local Gemma 3N is a tool for PET, not the other way around.

### **A Documentation Generator**

PET will **not** become a tool for:
- ❌ Auto-generating documentation
- ❌ Creating technical specifications
- ❌ Building knowledge bases
- ❌ Managing documentation workflows

**Why**: PET is for crafting prompts, not managing documentation. While prompts might be used to generate docs, that's not PET's purpose.

### **A Project Management Tool**

PET is **not** designed for:
- ❌ Task tracking or project planning
- ❌ Team collaboration or workflows
- ❌ Resource management
- ❌ Timeline planning

**Why**: PET is a focused tool for prompt engineering. Project management is outside its scope and would add unnecessary complexity.

### **A Social Platform**

PET will **not** include:
- ❌ User profiles or social features
- ❌ Sharing or community features
- ❌ Ratings or reviews
- ❌ Social networking capabilities

**Why**: PET is a private, individual tool. Social features would compromise privacy and distract from the core mission.

### **A Marketplace or Store**

PET is **not** a platform for:
- ❌ Selling or buying prompts
- ❌ Sharing prompt templates
- ❌ Commercial prompt services
- ❌ Monetization features

**Why**: PET is a tool, not a marketplace. Commercial features would compromise the open, privacy-first nature of the project.

### **A Research Platform**

PET is **not** designed for:
- ❌ Academic research on prompts
- ❌ Large-scale prompt analysis
- ❌ Prompt effectiveness studies
- ❌ Research data collection

**Why**: PET is a practical tool for prompt engineering, not a research platform. While research might be done with PET, that's not its primary purpose.

### **A Gaming Platform**

PET is **not** a game, despite the Tetris metaphor. We will not add:
- ❌ Scoring systems or leaderboards
- ❌ Game mechanics beyond the block metaphor
- ❌ Competitive features
- ❌ Entertainment-focused elements

**Why**: The Tetris metaphor is for interface design, not gaming. PET is a serious tool for prompt engineering.

### **A Content Management System**

PET is **not** a CMS for:
- ❌ Managing large prompt libraries
- ❌ Organizing content hierarchies
- ❌ Publishing prompts
- ❌ Content workflows

**Why**: PET is for crafting individual prompts, not managing large content collections.

### **A Workflow Automation Tool**

PET is **not** designed for:
- ❌ Automating business processes
- ❌ Creating workflow pipelines
- ❌ Integration with other tools
- ❌ Process automation

**Why**: PET is focused on prompt engineering, not workflow automation. While prompts might be used in automation, that's not PET's purpose.

## 🎯 Why These Boundaries Matter

### **Preventing Scope Creep**

By explicitly defining what PET is not, we:
- **Maintain focus** on the core mission
- **Avoid feature bloat** that dilutes the experience
- **Preserve simplicity** and ease of use
- **Protect performance** and reliability

### **Preserving Identity**

These boundaries ensure PET remains:
- **Privacy-first** and local
- **Constraint-driven** and focused
- **Accessibility-oriented** and inclusive
- **Tetris-inspired** and intuitive

### **Enabling Success**

By saying "no" to these features, we can:
- **Ship faster** with focused development
- **Maintain quality** with limited scope
- **Achieve excellence** in core functionality
- **Build community** around clear purpose

## 🚀 The PET Promise

PET will be:
- ✅ **Simple** - Easy to understand and use
- ✅ **Focused** - Does one thing exceptionally well
- ✅ **Private** - Your data stays on your device
- ✅ **Accessible** - Works for everyone
- ✅ **Powerful** - Professional-grade prompt engineering
- ✅ **Beautiful** - 80s terminal aesthetic
- ✅ **Fast** - Instant loading and response
- ✅ **Reliable** - Works offline, always available

**PET is the Tetris of prompt engineering - nothing more, nothing less.**
